/*
Prime Number
Task

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1. It has exactly two factors, that is, 1 and the number itself.
Create a function prime(uint n) . This prime() will check whether n is a prime number or not.
If n is a prime number then prime() returns 1 and n is not prime then prime() must return 0.
For Example - If n=103 then prime() must return 1 as 103 is a prime number. If n=200 then prime() must return 0 as 200 is not a prime number.

Note - Function will be public.
